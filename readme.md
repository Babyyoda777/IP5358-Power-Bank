The move towards USB-C is a great thing to bring a universal connector to all devices, making life more convenient. Unfortunately, power banks until now have been slow to make the move, sticking to USB-A and Micro usb. I designed a custom PCB which provides both USB-C Charging but also USB-C output for up to 22.5W, and it still features a USB-A port for backwards compatibility. The circuit itself is designed for 10,000mAh but can be configured for other capacities.
